# Color Hole Like Game

This is a poor copy of Color Hole game made by Good Job Games.

What I will add in coming days:
- Interlevel animations,
- Boundaries to playground
- Adding victim objects by scripts.
- Bonus level with a timer.
- Some new levels.

What I have achived so far:
- Game UI design.
- Destroying victims when they fall to the hole.
- Score system.
- Timer
